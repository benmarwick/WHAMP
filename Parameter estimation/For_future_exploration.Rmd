# Issues flagged for future exploration {#future_explore}

This section documents issues that we decided to flag for future consideration, perhaps when more data are available.

## Age distribution
We decided to weight the sample to match the age distribution reported for males in the census. The issue is that this may not correspond to the age distribution of MSM, particularly if there is differential migration for MSM and non-MSM. We could eventually try to tackle this, perhaps using Susie Cassel's data on migration patterns from the Mobile study. We could represent migration as changes in the regional attribute by age. However, incorporating this would require weighting the sample to the joint distriubtion of age and region, which stretch the current data quite thin. 

## Age mixing by age
Section \@ref(explore_heterogeneity) documents that parameterizing age mixing as the absolute difference in the square root of ego and alter ages does not fully acount for heterogeneity in age mixing by the age of the partners. Even after taking the difference in the cube root of ego and alter ages, age differences are greater for older egos. Further research is needed to identify ways to paramterize age mixing to remove heterogeneity by age.

## Network boundary specification
We decided to exclude data on most recent partners outside of the modeled age range (18-59), but we are keeping the egos who reported these partners in the network and including their out-of-range partners in calculation of momentary degree. In exploratory analyses, we observed that, compared to men who reported on partners in the age range, men whose most recent partners were outside of the modeled age range were more likely to be Hispanic and less likely to be "Other" race/ethnicity, more likely to have a main partner, reported lower coital frequency with main partners, and  were more likely to be bottoms and less likely to be versatile. Future work could explore the impact of dropping these men and/or consider including their out-of-range partnerships using a heat bath approach.

## Race mixing
We decided to collapse the off-diagonal elements and represent race mixing with a nodematch term due to small numbers by partner type. We also decided to collapse the persistent and instantaneous partnership networks in looking at race mixing due to the small numbers in some cells. With more data, future modeling work should represent these networks separately and use nodemix terms, as analyses indicated that the off-diagonal $\alpha_{ij}$ terms are heterogeneous (see section \@ref(mixing)).

## Sex role by age
In section \@ref(explore_heterogeneity), we observed that sex role varies by age. Plot \@ref(fig:plots_explore_sexrole) show some heterogeneity by age, but the effects are fairly modest. We decided not to stratify sex role by age in the model for this reason and because capturing heterogeneity in sex role by age is difficult; sex role influences the network model, such that this would introduce complexity in ensuring balance in age mixing. With more data and time to code and debug the model, this could be further explored.

## Three condom use typologies
The plots of condom use probabilites (\@ref(fig:plotsexplore_condoms_main), \@ref(fig:plotsexplore_condoms_pers), \@ref(fig:plotsexplore_condoms_inst)) suggest that there are three typologies of condom user: never, sometimes, and always. The trick with modeling condom use this way is that we would need to decide what happens at the dyad level: if a never and sometimes user pair up, are condoms used? What about if two sometimes users meet? The assigned probabilities of condom use would need to recreate the global mean probability. Also, this would effect the network model, as we would need an offset term to ensure that an always and a never condom user don't pair up. It would also be worth considering men's patterns of condom use across partner types and momentary degree: could define a type of men who never use condoms with main partners, but do with everyone else. The data from the WHPP survey do not seem adequate to address this issue, as men only reported on condom use with their most recent partner, so we don't know if that is representative of their condom use with all partners of that type or parnters of other types. Also, reported condom use is with a specific partner and we don't know what that partners' condom use preferences were and how they influenced use of condoms.

## PrEP use by race and region interaction
With more data, consider exploring whether PrEP uptake differs by the interaction of race/ethnicity and region.
