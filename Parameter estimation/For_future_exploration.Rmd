# Issues flagged for future exploration {#future_explore}

This section documents issues that we decided to flag for future consideration, perhaps when more data are available.

## Age distribution
We decided to weight the sample to match the age distribution reported for males in the census. The issue is that this may not correspond to the age distribution of MSM, particularly if there is differential migration for MSM and non-MSM. We could eventually try to tackle this, perhaps using Susie Cassel's data on migration patterns from the Mobile study. We could represent migration as changes in the regional attribute by age. However, incorporating this would require weighting the sample to the joint distriubtion of age and region, which stretch the current data quite thin. 

## Age mixing by age
Section \@ref(explore_heterogeneity) documents that parameterizing age mixing as the absolute difference in the square root of ego and alter ages does not fully acount for heterogeneity in age mixing by the age of the partners. Even after taking the difference in the cube root of ego and alter ages, age differences are greater for older egos. Further research is needed to identify ways to paramterize age mixing to remove heterogeneity by age.

## Network boundary specification
We decided to exclude data on most recent partners outside of the modeled age range (18-59), but we are keeping the egos who reported these partners in the network and including their out-of-range partners in calculation of momentary degree. In exploratory analyses, we observed that, compared to men who reported on partners in the age range, men whose most recent partners were outside of the modeled age range were more likely to be Hispanic and less likely to be "Other" race/ethnicity, more likely to have a main partner, reported lower coital frequency with main partners, and  were more likely to be bottoms and less likely to be versatile. Future work could explore the impact of dropping these men and/or consider including their out-of-range partnerships using a heat bath approach.

## Race mixing
We decided to collapse the off-diagonal elements and represent race mixing with a nodematch term due to small numbers by partner type. We also decided to collapse the persistent and instantaneous partnership networks in looking at race mixing due to the small numbers in some cells. With more data, future modeling work should represent these networks separately and use nodemix terms, as analyses indicated that the off-diagonal $\alpha_{ij}$ terms are heterogeneous (see section \@ref(mixing)).

## Sex role by age
In section \@ref(explore_heterogeneity), we observed that sex role varies by age. Plot \@ref(fig:plots_explore_sexrole) show some heterogeneity by age, but the effects are fairly modest. We decided not to stratify sex role by age in the model for this reason and because capturing heterogeneity in sex role by age is difficult; sex role influences the network model, such that this would introduce complexity in ensuring balance in age mixing. With more data and time to code and debug the model, this could be further explored.

## Three condom use typologies
The plots of condom use probabilites (\@ref(fig:plotsexplore_condoms_main), \@ref(fig:plotsexplore_condoms_pers), \@ref(fig:plotsexplore_condoms_inst)) suggest that there are three typologies of condom user: never, sometimes, and always. The trick with modeling condom use this way is that we would need to decide what happens at the dyad level: if a never and sometimes user pair up, are condoms used? What about if two sometimes users meet? The assigned probabilities of condom use would need to recreate the global mean probability. Also, this would effect the network model, as we would need an offset term to ensure that an always and a never condom user don't pair up. It would also be worth considering men's patterns of condom use across partner types and momentary degree: could define a type of men who never use condoms with main partners, but do with everyone else. The data from the WHPP survey do not seem adequate to address this issue, as men only reported on condom use with their most recent partner, so we don't know if that is representative of their condom use with all partners of that type or parnters of other types. Also, reported condom use is with a specific partner and we don't know what that partners' condom use preferences were and how they influenced use of condoms.

## PrEP use by race and region interaction
With more data, consider exploring whether PrEP uptake differs by the interaction of race/ethnicity and region.

## Behaviors in the absence of PrEP
A challenge with using data from the WHPP survey to estimate behavioral parameters is that ~20% of the sample is using PrEP, and some behaviors may have changed with the use of PrEP, such as condom use and possibly things like coital freuqency, sex role, and the number of partners. So including these men in estimating parameter values may yield over- or under-estimates, but PrEP users may have been different on these parameters before starting PrEP. 

One option for how to handle this is to fit a model conditional on a set of covariates and not being a recent PrEP user and then use this model to predict the parameter for PrEP users had they not been on PrEP. We would then combine the observed data from PrEP non-users with the predicted data from PrEP users to obtain our estimates. Covariates for these models would need to be carefully selected to try to adjust for confounders that might explain differences between PrEP users and non-users while avoiding variables that also may have changed with PrEP use. 

Another option is to use data from other sources (secondary datasets from before PrEP was scaled up or published longitudinal studies) to estimate either what the behaviors would be in the absence of PrEP or estimate what the change in the behavior is with PrEP use. These external estimates could be used in combination with the approach above to see whether model predictions align with other estimates.

In addition to sexual behaviors that might be shaped by risk compensation, HIV testing patterns change with PrEP use. In estimating interest intervals, we will not want to include data from PrEP users, but it is possible that men who have taken PrEP were more likely to test before initiating. We could use the prediction approach above to impute testing intervals for PrEP users from PrEP non-users who are of similar demographic and risk profiles. A limitation of this approach is that it is possible that the factor that explains why men on PrEP have initated PrEP and their similarly-indicated counterparts have not is that men who have initated PrEP were more likely to test, so it may not be possible to obtain "exchangeable" groups.
